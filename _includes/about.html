  <div id="Kelli" class="bio left-half">
    Kelli Ireland is half of Downright Simple and by trade is a software engineer, computer hardware engineer, process engineer, project manager, business analyst, and aspiring designer. The most visible project from her mobile hardware career was as lead engineer developing FedEx Ground’s STAR III, one of the first fully-integrated industrial mobile devices for delivery drivers. After her career shifted into process engineering and then IT project management, she entered grad school with the intention of becoming a career academic. Kelli missed building high-visibility products, so she put grad school on hold to become a full-time software engineer for UPMC Technology Development Center where her primary project was the recently-launched telemedicine product which allows patients and doctors to have video appointments over the internet. Kelli has a BS in Computer Engineering from the University of Pittsburgh, and one of these days she will complete her final project to finish her MS in Computer Science.

    Chris Allwein is half of Downright Simple and a career software engineer with over 15 years of industry experience. After graduating from Carnegie Mellon with a Computer Science degree, Chris spent a number of years in Harrisburg as a consultant in the public sector helping to improve efficiency and modernize the web-based delivery of government services for the Pennsylvania Game Commission, Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare, and Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. After being called in to rescue a failing Real Estate Tax Management project for the City of Baltimore, Chris returned to Pittsburgh where he began developing mobile applications. This led him to regional grocery retailer Giant Eagle, where he led the effort to deliver the initial versions of the Giant Eagle iPhone and Android applications and the follow-up applications for the GetGo chain of convenience stores. Following his successes there, Chris next landed at UPMC Technology Development Center where he led a team of mobile developers in creating a string of applications for users in the medical field, including a complex visualization app that enables doctors to get a one-stop view of a patient’s entire health history. Recently, Chris was talked into starting a mobile development company.
